# Acees the application 
# Local Machine:
If you're running the application locally, you can access it via localhost (127.0.0.1) on port 5000. Open your browser and go to: http://127.0.0.1:5000
# EC2 Instance: 
If the application is hosted on an AWS EC2 instance with a public IP, replace localhost with your EC2's public IP address. For example, if the EC2 public IP is 12.34.56.78, access the application using: http://12.34.56.78:5000

# Connecting to the Database:
Your application is now running with both web and database containers. You can connect to the PostgreSQL database using pgAdmin or any database viewer application.
**pgAdmin or DB Viewer:** Use the containerâ€™s IP or hostname, along with the PostgreSQL credentials (e.g., username, password, and port) defined in your docker-compose.yml or environment variables.
